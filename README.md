### Hi there, I'm Sondre! ðŸ‘‹

Senior developer working for [Aritma](https://www.aritma.com/) with a masters degree in algorithms from the University of Bergen. I have a passion for side projects, running and food. I'm also a firm believer in applying the KISS principle and the worse is better philosophy to my projects. I enjoy and use strongly typed languages, Linux and mechanical keyboards.

#### You can find me on...

- [The web](https://www.eons.io)
- <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@sondre">Mastodon</a>

And most everywhere else under the nickname `sondr3`.
