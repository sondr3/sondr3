### Hi there, I'm Sondre! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently doing my masters degree in informatics - algorithms specifically - at the University of Bergen. I have  a passion for safe and reliable software, open source and programming. I'm also a firm believer in applying the KISS principle and the worse is better philosophy to my projects. I enjoy and use strongly typed languages, Linux and mechanical keyboards.

#### You can find me on...
