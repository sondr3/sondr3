### Hi there, I'm Sondre! ðŸ‘‹

I am working at [Aritma](https://www.aritma.com/) as a senior software engineer with a masters degree in algorithms from the University of Bergen. I struggle with having too many side projects that are in various stages of done.  I'm a big fan of strongly typed languages with strict type systems, especially Rust and Haskell. In my spare time I love running, cooking, baking, brewing, fermenting and last but not least, eating said food. I also enjoy spending time with my pets, a ginger cat and a Mini American Shepherd.

#### You can find me on...
